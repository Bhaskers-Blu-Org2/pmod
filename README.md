## Welcome!

The pmod SDK is a Microsoft project to allow native code to be used on different languages and platforms with cross-platform in mind. The SDK offer both a runtime implementation and also code generation tools to easily produce 'projection' code into other languages like C#, WinRT, Objective-C, Java, NodeJS. It also offer additional support for MVVM pattern with support of observable obejcts that willl work on different platforms.
